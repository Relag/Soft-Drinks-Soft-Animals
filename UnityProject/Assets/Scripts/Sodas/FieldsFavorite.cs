He’d seen me behind the bar and forgotten what to say! (At least that’s what he tells me. I think maybe he was just daydreaming.)\nAnyway, I made him this drink, and...well, let’s just say it was probably the wrong choice. He spat it clean out! But it’s fine—he was the choice that mattered, in the end. And I chose right that time.\n—Aunt Dora";
